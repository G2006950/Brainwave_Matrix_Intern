🛠 Tools Used
Microsoft Power BI / Excel (or similar visualization tools)

Dataset (presumably from road transport authority or traffic department)

Image capture for dashboard presentation

🔍 Insights
Majority of casualties are slight injuries.

Car occupants represent the highest share of casualties.

Accidents on dry roads are most frequent, possibly due to high-speed conditions.

Daytime and urban areas are where most accidents occur.

Need for more safety measures on single carriageways and for two-wheelers.

🚀 Future Improvements
Add interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau online)

Include more filters: age group, gender, cause of accident

Add prediction model using machine learning
